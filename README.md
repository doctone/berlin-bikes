As a police officer:

x I want to see a list of reported bike thefts for the Berlin area.
x I want to see a detail page of the reported bike.
 I want to see the first 10 bike theft cases, with the ability to - paginate (10 cases per page).
 I want to see a total number of bike theft cases.
 For each reported bike theft I want to see:
 Case title
 Case description
 Date of the theft
 Date of when the case was reported
 Location of the theft
 Picture of the bike, if available
 I want to filter reported bike thefts by partial case title.
 I want to see a loading state until the list is available.
 I want to see an error state if the list is unavailable.
 I want to see an empty state if there are no results.
